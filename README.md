# challenge2: Portfolio Site
GA Tech Coding Bootcamp July 2022 -- Annie Nguyen
### Project description:
My portfolio site built on HTML and CSS.

### User Story
As an employer, I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

### User's journey
WHEN I load their portfolio </br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them </br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation </br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section </br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work </br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications </br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application </br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others </br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications </br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application </br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices </br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport </br>
